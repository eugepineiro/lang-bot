My name is Eugenia Pi√±eiro. I've graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering where I
specialized in Artificial Intelligence Systems.
I am currently looking for new opportunities that allow me to advance my professional
growth. I pride myself on being proactive and have a strong desire to continually
expand my knowledge and improve my existing skills.
I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and I have developed strategies that will
provide substantial value to the organization. I've proposed a new Data Augmentation
technique with Deep Learning models. The objective was to analyze the penetration of
chemotherapy in retina cancer cell clusters, making a significant contribution not only
to the field of information technology but also to the field of medicine. The results are
published by IEEE ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10178851
I have a robust background in with Artificial Intelligence, which is readily evident
through the related projects showcased in my portfolio (eugepineiro.github.io). There,
you will discover implementations of diverse Neural Networks, projects centered
around Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and more.
I'm consistently ready to support my colleagues in reaching our collective goals. My
strong organizational skills and attention to detail enable me to effectively manage my
time, contributing to the team's overall success.
I would greatly appreciate your review of my attached resume, where you will find a
diverse range of skills, including proficiency in multiple programming languages and
frameworks.
